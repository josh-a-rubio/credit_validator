ðŸ”‘ Credit Card Validator

A C program that validates credit card numbers using a 3-step layered approach:

Sanitation Check â†’ ensures input is the correct length (12â€“19 digits) and contains only numbers.

Luhnâ€™s Algorithm â†’ verifies the number passes the checksum rule used by real credit cards.

IIN (Issuer Identification Number) Check â†’ identifies the card issuer (Visa, MasterCard, AMEX, Discover, Diners Club, JCB).
